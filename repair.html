                        <p class="common__card-ph">Normal wear and tear can affect cooling performance, but there are a few common issues that prevent an air conditioner from maintaining the desired temperature.</p>
                        <ul class="common__card-list">
                            <li class="common__card-item"><span class="blue-text">Dirty Filters. </span> One of the most common problems, a dirty filter can increase energy consumption, cause frozen evaporator coils, and can contribute to unhealthy indoor Fortunately, these issues are preventable by cleaning and replacing your AC filter often. </li>
                            <li class="common__card-item"><span class="blue-text">Refrigerant: </span>Your AC unit may have old, ineffective refrigerant or coolant may have dissipated or leaked out. A normal amount of refrigerant is required for proper cooling performance. </li>
                            <li class="common__card-item"><span class="blue-text">Sensor Problems: </span>Your air conditioner contains numerous sensors that relay information. Over time, they can start sending false readings, causing an AC to work less reliably and efficiently.</li>
                            <li class="common__card-item"><span class="blue-text">Thermostat Issues: </span>Your thermostat may not be properly reading the accurate air temperature, causing your system to “think” it is running properly when it is not.</li>
                            <li class="common__card-item"><span class="blue-text">Drainage Problems: </span>An air conditioner creates condensate that must be drained away to avoid excess moisture, mold, and other problems. AC drains can become clogged with dust, dirt, and rust. </li>
                            <li class="common__card-item"><span class="blue-text">Dirty Coils: </span>If the condenser coils are coated in dirt or residue, they won’t dissipate heat as effectively. The air conditioner will also work harder to cool your home; when the coils get dirty enough, it won’t ever reach the desired temperature.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="common__card-ph">If your AC doesn’t respond when you turn it on or the thermostat is programmed to start it, this may be due to one of these reasons:</p>
                        <ul class="common__card-list">
                            <li class="common__card-item"><span class="blue-text">Electric Control Failure: </span>Compressor and fan controls can wear out due to overworking or connections may become corroded. Thermostat Failure: There are a variety of reasons your thermostat can fail, preventing a successful connection to your AC.</li>

                            <li class="common__card-item"><span class="blue-text">Dirty Condensers: </span> A condenser line can get dirty, mold or algae can grow on it, twigs and branches may build up on it, or birds may set up a nest. These can all stop your AC from working until you clear away any debris. Make sure the evaporator coils are clean as well. </li>
                            <li class="common__card-item"><span class="blue-text">Lack of Power: </span> If your AC is not working it may not be getting electricity. This is easy to go unnoticed due to HVAC units having their own circuits. Make sure to check your circuit breaker.</li>
                            <li class="common__card-item"><span class="blue-text">Wiring Problem: </span>An issue with your air conditioner or other electric appliances can originate with the wiring in your home. Be aware of flickering lights or listen for humming when you plug things in.</li>
